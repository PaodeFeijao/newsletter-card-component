# Paodekueijo's Newsletter

This is a newsletter project made by me as a solution to a frontend challenge from [Frontendpro](https://www.frontendpro.dev)

Well, the design is from frontend pro, max the code was made 100% by me. 😅

Actually Windows XP window was made by [Ash Kyd](https://github.com/AshKyd), I hope he will allow me to leave the window on my website 🙏 (If you don't allow it, send me an email! 😉)  

## Netlify

If you don't want to see just code, take a look at my repository hosted on [Netlify](https://paodekueijonewsletter.netlify.app)
